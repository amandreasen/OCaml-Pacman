In order to construct the mazes that the game is played on, we hard coded three 
maps in [map.ml]. Each map is nearly 70 lines of code, and we did not count any 
of these three mazes towards our lines of code count. 

Additionally, we created a file to store various constants that we use 
throughout the code. We did not count the [constants.ml] or [constants.mli] 
towards our lines of code either.
