How to install and build the system.

***Note: Our application uses an X11 GUI display. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is incapable of displaying the GUI directly. If you have a Windows machine, we recommend following the below instructions in a Linux VM instance (we tested our install with Ubuntu). Mac and Linux OS users should not have display issues.

1. Follow the course guidelines for installing OCaml on your device. This includes having a local installation. You'll want to make sure you follow the directions for installing and initializing OPAM, installing XQuartz (Mac only), and having a package manager. 

2. Install the OCaml Graphics package. You will need to install it using your operating system's package manager. The command [opam install graphics] should be sufficient. If it is not sufficient, the terminal should prompt you with an informative error message that should indicate how you should proceed.

You may be prompted with an error message saying that you need to install [pkgconfig]. In this case, you should install this package using a package manager for your OS. If on a Mac, you will want to run the command [sudo port install pkgconfig] (if using MacPorts package manager) or [brew install pkg-config] (if using Homebrew package manager) and then try to run [opam install graphics]. If on Linux, you can try to run the command [sudo apt-get install pkg-config].

3. Download the source code and navigate to that directory from your command line/terminal. Running the command [make play] will start the GUI. Note that at this point the GUI is only a visual representation of our vision. 

4. Navigate to the directory containing the source code in VS Code to see our current progress.
