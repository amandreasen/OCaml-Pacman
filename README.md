# PAC-MAN
This is a graphical-interface implementation of the classic PAC-MAN game. The aim of the game is to collect all the food in the maze without getting caught by the ghosts. Special food appears for power-ups or bonus points. The pink food activates a role-reversal situation where the player (shown by the classic yellow character) can actually eat the ghosts and gain points. Once a maze is cleared - there is no more food remaining - then you have successfully completed the level and a new maze will appear. There are three maps, one classic looking maze, a "CS 3110" maze in honor of the course that this project was developed during, and a third map that says "OCAML" because this was the primary programming language used for the development of the project.
